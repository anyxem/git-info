### Commit Message Format

A commit message consists of a **header**, **body** and **footer**.  The header has a **type**, **scope** and **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

### Type

- `feat` - new feature;
- `fix` - bugfix;
- `docs` - update in documentation;
- `style` - styling that not affect functionality, just appearance;
- `refactor` - code refactoring, that not affect functionality;
- `test` - added or updated test;
- `chore` - changes in build system, eg webpack, grunt, linters etc.

If the prefix is `feat`, `fix` or `perf`, it will appear in the changelog. However if there is any [BREAKING CHANGE](#footer), the commit will always appear in the changelog.

Other prefixes are up to your discretion. Suggested prefixes are `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`, and `test` for non-changelog related tasks.

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `header`,`footer`,`some page`,`table component`, etc...

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
